HelloWorld Scala Servlet

This is a very simple servlet meant to demonstrate embedding jetty in scala
using sbt 0.11 in order to create a runnable servlet.  The documentation around
using the latest version of Jetty with sbt 0.11 was rather skimpy so this took
much longer than it should have.

It wasn't clear whether the xsbt-web-plugin
(https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin/) worked with Jetty 8, but
apparantly it does.  The xsbt-web-plugin is added in project/plugins.sbt.
It is also necessary to have Jetty on the classpath for the "container"
scope, as specified in the build.xml.

To run this program, in sbt run:

  container:start

Then you can see "Hello world!" at http://localhost:8080/.

Here are a few other commands:

  container:reload
  container:stop

Sometimes it's nice to have your project continuously deployed (deployed after
each saved change):

  container:start
  ~aux-compile


NOTES
=====
The above is cloned from https://github.com/schmmd/helloworld-scala-servlet (https://github.com/schmmd/helloworld-scala-servlet.git).

When creating servlets that are run by SBT and the xsbt-web-plugin (https://github.com/JamesEarlDouglas/xsbt-web-plugin),
we must have a web.xml to define the servlet.
However, if we only use the web plugin to package a war file; then we can deploy that war file to our own running tomcat
instance and it will work without a web.xml (using the @WebServlet annotation instead).
(to deploy a war to tomcat just drop it in the webapps folder and restart tomcat.)
